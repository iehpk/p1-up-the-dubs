                <p>We have a few options to get around Dublin City. We can make use of the Dublin Bus, Dublin Bikes, Luas, Trains and

                    <p class="section-p">The Leap Card in an electronic pass that can be used on almost all public transportation which comes in three flavors; A
                    visitor’s unlimited pass which serves 1, 2, 3, or 7 days, A special card for citizens with a photograph which is mailed
                    to your address for easy management and a general one which works the same way and both can be topped up with credit as
                    you go.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Leap Cards also have special discounts as fares are always less than when paying with cash. Thus, it is advised to get
                    the Leap Card if you will be making use of public transportation.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Leap Cards can also be used on Dublin Bikes!</p>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">Luas</h2>
                    <p class="section-p">The Luas, not to be confused with the tram which runs on the normal railway, has two lines; Red and Green, which run
                    perpendicular to one another and meet on O’Connell Street. The red line runs across Dublin while the green line goes
                    from south to north.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">The Luas can get you to both Train Stations (Connolly and Heuston), to the Guinness Store House, Pheonix Park, 3Arena,
                    Museum for Natural Arts and Kilmainham Gaol.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">For payment, both cards and cash are accepted, and you can pay for the ticket or journey at each stop. In addition,
                    there is a special pass called Leap Card.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">Dublin Bus</h2>
                    <p class="section-p">Almost all Dublin Buses traverse through the City Center (through or close to O’Connell Street). They are identified by
                    their standout colors of yellow, blue and green. The labels are the destination and the route number.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Dublin Buses accept Leap Cards, printed bus passes – which can be purchased from News Agent shops, Luas stops or Dublin
                    Buss office on O’Connell Street, and cash payments. For cash payments, only coins are acceptable. It is advisable to use
                    exact change unless you are willing to travel to the main Dublin Buss office to get your change back.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Dublin Buses normally run between 06:30 up 23:30. There are special buses (C, H) which run past these times but only on
                    weekdays, excluding bank holidays. After midnight, the C (C1, C2, C3, etc) and H (H1, H2, etc) runs every hour.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">Dublin Bikes</h2>
                    <p class="section-p">The Dublin Bikes are mostly locked in the City, meaning you will not find bike stops far from the City Center. The
                    Dublin Bikes are available for use between 06:00 and 00:30. An account is required to use the Dublin Bikes as a yearly
                    or a single subscription is needed to make use of the service.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">The charge is €35 for a year or €5 for a day’s use. When on a subscription, the journey is free when less than 30
                    minutes, thereafter which there will be a charge of €0.50 cents every other half hour. This means that you can use the
                    bike overnight but be prepared to pay for that time.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">You can find a lot of stations in the City Center with two on O’Connell Street (General Post Office and Living Room Pub)
                    alone.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">Train & Dart</h2>
                    <p class="section-p">Wish to go to Howth – the prestigious fishing village - the best place to have fresh sea food? Or perhaps you wish to
                    spend the precious sunny times at the beach in Dan Laoghaire and Swords? The Dart is the best option! It takes less than
                    30 minutes to get to Howth and even less to get to the beach.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Connolly station serves the East coast and thus the beach. Great news is that Connolly is not far from the Spire, under
                    ten minutes' walk in fact. The other station, Heuston, serves the west coast, in the case that you wish to visit outside
                    Dublin, like the Cliffs of Moher or Giant’s Causeway in the North.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">Tickets are easy to get, either online from the Irish Rail website or at the stations themselves. In addition, the Leap
                    card is also valid on the trains and darts.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-h2">Walking and Others</h2>
                    <p class="section-p">Why not put in those steps when you can! Optimum walking distance for Dublin city from Seaside to end of Pheonix Park is at average two hours.</p>
                    <p class="section-p">That is the extreme estimate. The attractions are mostly in the center which is very manageable. It is also not recommended to drive around the city due to the one-way road rules in place and not to mention traffic!</p>
                    <p class="section-p">If you must travel via transoprtation, Uber is available in addition to horse rides.</p>
