<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is my project for the first semester in Code Institute for HTML and CSS. It was built using only the pure concepts learned in the module.</p>
<p>There was a long period ot time trying to think of a project, which only came to me about 8 days before deadline. Having been in Dublin for a while, I figured a real life relevant project would be ideal and thus an idea of a Dublin Visitor Website came to me</p>
