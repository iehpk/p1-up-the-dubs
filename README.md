<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my project for the first semester in Code Institute for HTML and CSS. It was built using only the pure concepts learned in the module.</p>
<p>There was a long period ot time trying to think of a project, which only came to me about 8 days before deadline. Having been in Dublin for a while, I figured a real life relevant project would be ideal and thus an idea of a Dublin Visitor Website came to me</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Long time spent deciding on the project. Even longer time designing as I kept complicating the requirements.</p>
<p>Borrowed a Sony @6000 camera from my friend and walked around Dublin taking photos to use for the project.</p>
<p>Images I needed but could not take were taken from online sources;</p>

</ul>
<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Codeanywhere Online IDE</li>
    <li>Github</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Fontawesome</li>
    <li>Adobe Lightroom Classic</li>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
    <li>Sony &Alpha;6000</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usability Settings</h2>
<p>Used CSS to create different layouts for different resolutions;</p>
<ol>
    <li>>1600px</li>
    <li>>1300px</li>
    <li>>960px</li>
    <li>>600px</li>
    <li>>500px</li>
    <li>>400px</li>
</ol>
<p>Used smaller sized images for smaller resolutions and in some cases removed images all together for smallest devices.</p>
<p>Menu and Headings changed according to the resolution cut-off point.</p>
<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p>As the website is about visiting DUblin, the primary colors are of the Irish flag;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>White</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
<p>These colors were used in tandem in both text, and layout color choices.</p>
<p>Fonts were changed three times as I tested for both personal preference and visual quality.</p>
<p>After a few tests, I finally settled on the <em>Metrophobic</em> font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
<p>Font-sizes were based off of personal preference per resolution.</p>
<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>Got boggled down by project choices as I kept over-thinking the project. Due to this, I had little time left to do the actual project.</p>
<p>Positioning was a big challenge, practical-wise. Kept making use of online solutions like StackOverflow, etc...</p>
