<p>You can preview the project live on this -> <a href="https://iehpk.github.io/p1-up-the-dubs/" class="link-text">LINK</a></p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This is my project for the first semester in Code Institute for HTML and CSS. It was built using only the pure concepts learned in the module.</p>
<p>There was a long period ot time trying to think of a project, which only came to me about 8 days before deadline. Having been in Dublin for a while, I figured a real life relevant project would be ideal and thus an idea of a Dublin Visitor Website came to me</p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<p>Long time spent deciding on the project. Even longer time designing as I kept complicating the requirements.</p>
<p>Borrowed a Sony @6000 camera from my friend and walked around Dublin taking photos to use for the project.</p>
<p>Images I needed but could not take were taken from online sources;</p>

</ul>
<h2>Programming Languages</h2>
<ol>
    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
</ol>
<h2>Tools & Technologies Used</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Codeanywhere Online IDE</li>
    <li>Github</li>
    <li>Git</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Fontawesome</li>
    <li>Adobe Lightroom Classic</li>
    <li>Adobe Photoshop</li>
    <li>Sony &Alpha;6000</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usability Settings</h2>
<p>Used CSS to create different layouts for different resolutions;</p>
<ol>
    <li>>1600px</li>
    <li>>1300px</li>
    <li>>960px</li>
    <li>>600px</li>
    <li>>500px</li>
    <li>>400px</li>
</ol>
<p>Used smaller sized images for smaller resolutions and in some cases removed images all together for smallest devices.</p>
<p>Menu and Headings changed according to the resolution cut-off point.</p>
<h2>Design Choices</h2>
<p>As the website is about visiting DUblin, the primary colors are of the Irish flag;</p>
<ul>
    <li>Green</li>
    <li>White</li>
    <li>Orange</li>
</ul>
<p>These colors were used in tandem in both text, and layout color choices.</p>
<p>Fonts were changed three times as I tested for both personal preference and visual quality.</p>
<p>After a few tests, I finally settled on the <em>Metrophobic</em> font from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Fonts</a>.</p>
<p>Font-sizes were based off of personal preference per resolution.</p>
<h2>Validation</h2>
<p>Made use of W3C's <a href="https://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">HTML</a> and <a href="https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/" target="_blank">CSS</a> Validators to validate my HTML and CSS code.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>In this section we will walk through the pages of the wbsite, of which there are 6.</p>

    <li>Introduction</li>
    <li>Transportation</li>
    <li>Attractions</li>

<h3>1. Welcome Page</h3>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/zn2sSTg/s-intro-lg.jpg" alt="s-intro-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/X2Q0VJJ/s-intro-md.jpg" alt="s-intro-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/G33b89v/s-intro-sm.jpg" alt="s-intro-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<p>This is the landing page which contains a background image that has two sources depending on the resolution, for responsiveness.</p>
<p>The first page was a challenge as it required positioning on the div elements to make them fit right.</p>
<h3>Introduction Page</h3>
<a href="https://ibb.co/KWWG8wn"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/dDDcHgZ/s-welcome-lg.jpg" alt="s-welcome-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/k1wDFQ9/s-welcome-md.jpg" alt="s-welcome-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/60S8YdS/s-welcome-sm.jpg" alt="s-welcome-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<p>The Introduction Page was the easiest as it contains little content.</p>
<p>It has a PICTURE element with different sources to cater to different resolutions.</p>
<p>The paragraphs wrap around the image.</p>
<p>Her we meet the Nagivation Element with links to other pages. Due to short of time, not all I wanted to do with it was done. Like putting child links to go to different location on the same page.</p>
<p>It also has a footer, which shows different content depending on resolution. For example, the map does not show on small devices and the background image changes.</p>
<h3>Transportation Page</h3>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xCQYXg1/s-trans-lg.jpg" alt="s-trans-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/PgJCnx4/s-trans-md.jpg" alt="s-trans-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/FhrG2fc/s-trans-sm.jpg" alt="s-trans-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<p>The content here changes as we need to use article and sections.</p>
<p>Used DIV elements to help with styling, like the triangle on every heading 2 element.</p>
<p>Photos are background images while headings are the content.</p>
<p>The triangle CSS trick was learned from a user online on StackOverflow.</p>
<h3>Attractions Page</h3>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/0sGVzyk/s-attract-lg.jpg" alt="s-attract-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/vjPqMGd/s-attract-md.jpg" alt="s-attract-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/M6brSVf/s-attract-sm.jpg" alt="s-attract-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<p>The Attractions Page was almost like the Transportation Page but with more elements.</p>
<p>Added a third heading and content block and in addition, made use of Google Maps to include some Map IFRAME elements</p>
<p>Positioning played a role in this page, mostly within the section heading divs.</p>
<h3>Contact Us Page</h3>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/0CfyKDP/s-contact-lg.jpg" alt="s-contact-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/nb15Cwy/s-contact-md.jpg" alt="s-contact-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/LCbPB9C/s-contact-sm.jpg" alt="s-contact-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;"></a>
<p>The COntact Us Page introduces the FORM element and while it is functional, nothing is sent anywhere as there is no server functionality.</p>
<p>Instead the user, after the form has been validated by the browser, will be forwarded to the Result Page that has a message for them.</p>
<p>Validation include a valid email, name longer than 2 characters (In case of Eastern names) and message not being empty!</p>
<h3>Result Page</h3>
<a href="https://ibb.co/Sx0T4hd"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pPZDBtR/s-result-lg.jpg" alt="s-result-lg" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/LpKsyRR/s-result-md.jpg" alt="s-result-md" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">></a>
<a href="https://imgbb.com/"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/TqpHzJ0/s-result-sm.jpg" alt="s-result-sm" border="0" style="width: 30%; height: auto;">></a>
<p>This is a simple page with a THANK YOU text for the user on having contacted us.</p>
<h3>Future/UnFinished Functionality</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Sub-Links to navigate in current page when it gets long.</li>
    <li>Better visual presentation.</li>
    <li>Satisfying Element positioning.</li>
    <li>Amination.</li>
    <li>Video and Photo Gallery media</li>
    <li>Functioning Form.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Challenges Faced</h2>
<p>Got boggled down by project choices as I kept over-thinking the project. Due to this, I had little time left to do the actual project.</p>
<p>Positioning was a big challenge, practical-wise. Kept making use of online solutions like StackOverflow, etc...</p>
